This package includes Matlab scripts to create a coupled landscape evolution - crustal stress model. The landscape evolution model is a 1D model that was originally published by O'Hara et al. (2019). The crustal stress model is in 2D (x-z) and is a Matlab version of the Python model originally created by Styron & Hetland (2015) (GitHub code available at https://github.com/cossatot/halfspace). 

The paper that introduces these algorithms is currently under review in Frontiers in Earth Science, and should be referenced as:

O'Hara, D., and Karlstrom, L. (in review). Distributed volcano erosion patterns imply coupled volcanism and regional climate in the Cascades arc, U.S.A. Frontiers in Earth Science.

The repository contains a series of folders related to the models. The 1D landscape evolution model is contained within the 1D_LEM folder, and contains a set of example scripts users can run. The 2D crustal stress model is contained within the 2D_Model_CrustalStress folder, and also contains example scripts users can run based on the example landscape evolution scripts. The Model_Results folder is used as a temporary repository for example model results. The O'Hara_Karstrom_Model folder contains the data and scripts to recreate the model/figures from O'Hara & Karlstrom (in review).

Finally, the Other_Scripts folder includes a script not created by the authors, but used within the repository. Script reference is:
